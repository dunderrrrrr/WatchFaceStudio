# Watch Face Studio Projects

This is a collection of my watch faces for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4. Most of them probably work with other Samsung Galaxy watches but it's not yet tested.

Every watch face folder contain a `.wfs` file. This file can be imported in Watch Face Studio. WFS can be downloaded [here](https://developer.samsung.com/watch-face-studio/download.html). There is an inline guide in the software describing how to connect the watch to your host.

## Get started

1. Download Watch Face Studio from the link above.
2. Select a project, download the `.wfs` file and import it in WFS.
3. Select "Run on watch" in the top right corner. Click the "?" for a guide how to connect your watch. I recommend connecting using WiFi.
